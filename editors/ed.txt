Command format:

 start,endC parameters

 All fields are optional, with helpful defaults.
 Here C is command name.  All names are one character, case senstive, default is l.
 start, end are line addresses.
 If both are present, command applies to all lines in range.
 If only start is present, command applies to that line.
 If both are absent, most commands apply to the current line.
 Most commands move the current line to the last affected line.
 Parameters may be separated from command name C by zero or more spaces
 Parameters may be file or buffer names, search/replace strings, ...
 All commands are terminated by RETURN (including the empty command).
 a,i,c enter input mode, where you type lines of text to add to buffer.
 Type . by itself at the start of a line to exit input mode.
