demo.py
=======

**demo.py** demonstrates many features of the Piety system,
including concurrent tasks, job control, editors, a windowing system,
and an enhanced shell.

**demo.py** uses the Piety scheduler to run the four jobs created by
*session.py*, concurrently with two timestamp tasks.  Each timestamp
task uses the *print* function to update an editor buffer.  You can
see these buffers update in their windows as you edit in another window
or in the command line.

Here is a sample session that demonstrates this.  Here *>>* is the
Python prompt and *:* is the editor command
prompt, you type the commands that follow.  First, start the script and
run the [eden](../editors/eden.md) display editor.
The *eden* screen with one window appears:

    ... $ python3 -im demo
    .   ts1                  0  ts1
    .   ts2                  0  ts2
    . * main                 1  None
    >> eden(c=12)
    ... eden screen with 12-line scrolling region appears ...

Next, type commands at the *eden* command prompt to create
two new windows that show timestamps updating, then traverse to
the original *main* window:

    :o2
    :b ts1
    . * ts1                 61  ts1
    :o2
    :b ts2
    . * ts2                105  ts2
    :o
    :o

Then, at the prompt, type the *eden* *C* command to change to
display editing mode. (That's a capital *C*, it is case sensitive.)

    :C

The cursor moves into the *main* window.  Type and edit text
in the window in the usual way for [eden](../editors/eden).
Notice that the lines generated by the two timestamp
tasks keep appearing and
scrolling up in the *ts1* and *ts2* windows as you edit.

To exit display editing mode and return to the command prompt, type *^Z*.
(control-Z).

Some interesting commands to type at the *eden* command prompt:

 - *b ts1* - in the focus window, display the buffer that contains the
 timeout messages from ts1task.  This window updates each time the
 task generates a new message, even when another window gets focus
 and updates as its text is edited.

Some interesting Python commands to type at the *eden* command prompt
(prefix each command with an exclamation point, *!*).
Or, switch to the Python interpreter by typing an exclamation point
by itself at the *eden* command prompt (then you can return to the *eden*
command line by typing a colon *:* by itself at the Python prompt).

 - *jobs()* - show information about jobs

 - *piety.tasks()* - show information about tasks

 - *ts1task.enabled=piety.false* - disable *ts1task* so *ts1* buffer stops updating

 - *ts1task.enabled=piety.true* -  enable *ts1task* so *ts1* buffer resumes updating

 - *ts1task.enabled=alternate* - run *ts1task* handler on alternate timeout events

 - *piety.cycle.period=0.1* - cause *ts1* buffer to update ten times a second

 - *piety.cycle.period=1.0* - cause *ts1* buffer to resume updating once a second

 - *edm.a('append line after dot')* - or any other call from the *ed* API.

**demo.py** can also demonstrate the jobs and job control
provided by [session.py](session.md) and the enhanced shell and
scripting provided by [edo.py](../editors/edo.md).

### Bugs ###

The demonstration works as intended when you run the display editor
*eden*.  It does not work when you run the display editor *edsel*.
With *edsel*, the cursor jumps to the beginning of the line
on each timer tick.   A partial explanation appears in the
comments in [demo.py](demo.py).   At this time we have not decided
on the best solution for this.
