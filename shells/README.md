Callable Python shells

- **pysh.py**: Python shell, based on standard library *code* module. 

- **salysh.py**: Defines the *pysh* *Console* job that wraps the *pysh.py*
  Python shell. Contrast to *pysh.py* *main* function.

- **samysh.md**: Description of *samysh.py*.

- **samysh.py**: Execute a command with optional echo and delay.
  Useful for observing the execution of test scripts.

- **shellcmd.py**: provide a function to invoke a shell command.

- **wyshka.md**: Description of *wyshka.py*.

- **wyshka.py**: Shell that can alternate between *pysh* (Python) and
  the command line interface to another application program, such as
  *ed*.  You can use Python without leaving the application.  This shell
  can also redirect command output from the application or from Python
  to a text buffer instead of the terminal.

- **wyshka.txt**: Summary of *whyska.py*.

Our *pysh.py* is not related to the abandoned project also named 
[pysh](http://pysh.sourceforge.net/) mentioned on this page on
[alternative shells](https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/ExternalResources).
