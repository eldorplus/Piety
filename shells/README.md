Callable Python shells

- **pysh.py**: Python shell, based on standard library *code* module. 

- **salysh.py**: Run *pysh.py* Python shell, use *console*
  module instead of Python builtin *input* to collect and edit
  input lines without blocking.  Contrast to *pysh.py* *main* function.

- **samysh.py**: Execute a command with optional echo and delay.
  Useful for observing the execution of test scripts.

- **wyshka.py**: Shell that can alternate between *pysh* (Python) and
  the command line interface to another application program, such as
  *ed*.  You can use Python without leaving the application.
