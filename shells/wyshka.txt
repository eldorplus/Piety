wyshka.py summary

Switching between shells.  In application shell (usually edsel):

    :<command>       execute application <command>
    :!<statement>    push Python <statement> to pysh, return to application command mode
    .. <statement>   push Python continuation line <statement> to pysh
    :!               switch to Python mode

In Python:

    >> <statement>   push Python <statement> to pysh
    .. <statment>    push Python continuation line <statement> to pysh
    >>:<command>     execute application <command>, return to pysh interpreter
    >>:              switch to application command mode

Redirect output of command to named buffer, works in both application and
Python modes. To rewrite buffer contents, so any previous contents are lost:

    > bufname command

To append command output to the buffer, preserving previous contents:

    >> bufname command
