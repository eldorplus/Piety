In this API there are no optional or keyword arguments.
There is no error checking, no error messages, and no progress messages.
Numeric line addresses use Python numbering conventions:
the first line is number 0 and the last line number is length-1.
Ranges use Python slice conventions: the first element is at the
start index, the last element is at one less than the end index.
