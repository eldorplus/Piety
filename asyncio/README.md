asyncio
=======

Non-blocking event loop using the Python *asyncio* module.

The platform-independent *piety* module can import the *eventloop*
module from this directory.  The *bin/asyncio_paths* command puts this
directory on the *PYTHONPATH*

This directory is platform-dependent.  The *asyncio* module is part of
the Python 3 standard library, but in version 3.4.3 it is still
considered *provisional* (subject to change or removal), and may not
be supported on all platforms.
