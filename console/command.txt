Editing and history command summary for command.py.  Functions are
defined in each Command object's keymap.  These are in the default keymap.

Dedicated function keys:

 ret  execute command line
 bs   delete character before cursor
 del  delete character before cursor
 left (arrow key) move cursor back one character
 right (arrow key) move cursor forward one character
 up   (arrow key) retrieve previous line from history
 down (arrow key) retrieve next line from history

Control keys: hold down control key while typing the named key, upper or lowercase

 ^A  move cursor to start of line 
 ^B  move cursor (b)ack one character
 ^C  interrupt application, write traceback
 ^D  (d)elete character under cursor; if line is empty, exit application
 ^E  move cursor to (e)nd of line
 ^F  move cursor (f)orward one character
 ^H  delete character before cursor (like bs)
 ^J  enter newline to create multi-line input, do not execute command
 ^K  delete (kill) line from cursor to end
 ^L  redraw line (useful if line has become garbled with control characters)
 ^M  execute command (like ret)
 ^N  retrieve (n)ext line from history
 ^P  retrieve (p)revious line from history
 ^U  discard line, start over with an empty line

Printing characters are inserted before the cursor.
Unhandled control characters ring the bell.

^D only exits application if job control has also been programmed to recognize it.

These functions require a display terminal with cursor addressing:
 left right ^A ^B ^D ^E ^F ^K
These keys must be removed from the keymap for printing terminals.
There is an alternate method to put in the keymap to support bs del ^H
 on printing terminals, by printing \x to indicate x has been deleted.
