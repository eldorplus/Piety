Here are examples of systems software written in Python.  Here we
exclude exclude programs which are Python wrappers around a core
written in another language (like many modules in the Python
standard library).  We also exclude programs written in other
languages that can be scripted in Python.

| Program | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) also [here](http://www.aosabook.org/en/pypy.html)  | Python compiler written in Python |
| [cffi](http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) also [here](http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/08/cffi-release-03.html) | "Foreign Function Interface for Python calling C code. The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python. The interface is based on LuaJITâ€™s FFI. ... The goal is to call C code from Python. You should be able to do so without learning a 3rd language: every alternative requires you to learn their own language (Cython, SWIG) or API (ctypes)."  From the PyPy project. |
| [TCPStack](https://github.com/dound/vns/blob/master/TCPStack.py) | Lightweight TCP stack.  Part of [VNS](http://yuba.stanford.edu/vns/), the "Virtual Network System for teaching and experimentation" (also [here](http://yuba.stanford.edu/vns/files/pub/vns_sigcse.pdf)). |
| [Linux Framebuffer](http://blog.daum.net/nskystars/2626663) | "Drawing to the Linux Framebuffer in Python" Writes to /dev/fb0 using fcntl, mmap, struct.  Looks like a general technique for doing low-level I/O in Linux.  Based on C code [here](http://doc.qt.digia.com/3.0/emb-framebuffer-howto.html), but simpler. |
| [terminal](http://blog.daum.net/nskystars/2644517) | "A Simple Linux Framebuffer Terminal in Python (and C)" using the techniques above | 
| [Python X Library](http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net/) | "a fully functional X client library for Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, in contrast to earlier X libraries for Python (the ancient X extension and the newer plxlib) which were interfaces to the C Xlib." |
| [tinywm](http://incise.org/tinywm.html) | "a tiny window manager that I created as an exercise in minimalism. ... It is only around 50 lines of C. There is also a Python version using python-xlib." |
| [Cairo](http://www.tortall.net/mu/wiki/CairoTutorial) | 2d vector graphics, similar to SVG, PostScript, PDF, HTML Canvas, ... |
| [peppy](http://peppy.flipturn.org/) | "an XEmacs-like editor in Python" |
