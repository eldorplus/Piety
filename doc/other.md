Here are some examples of pertinent system software and utilities
written in languages other than Python.

| Component | Type | Language | Description|
|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| [/grub-core/fs](http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/grub/trunk/grub/files/head:/grub-core/fs/) ([via](http://ask.metafilter.com/230728/NTFS-FAT-HFS-Drowning-in-Acronyms#3339280)) | Read-only file systems | C | "The bootloader Grub 2 includes minimal, read-only drivers for a gazillion different file systems. ...  it's much simpler code than most drivers, since it's read-only. Plus, you can even run it in userland, which means you can easily attach a debugger and see exactly what's going on." |
| [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/), also [here](http://redartisan.com/2007/10/5/rubinius-getting-started) and [here](http://razzledazzle.it/1:origin-story/3:rubinius) | Interpreter/Compiler | Ruby | "Rubinius is an alternate implementation of the Ruby virtual machine, loosely based on the architecture and implementation of Smalltalk-80." "The Rubinius bytecode virtual machine is written in C++, incorporating LLVM to compile bytecode to machine code at runtime. The bytecode compiler and vast majority of the core classes are written in pure Ruby."  Interesting contrast to [PyPy](http://pypy.org/). |
|[PEG](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2010003_PEG.pdf) (Parsing Expression Grammar) | Compiler | various | "PEG-based transformer provides front-, middle-and back-end stages in a simple compiler", "highly suited to implementing its own implementation language".  Applied in [OMeta](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2007003_ometa.pdf), also [here](http://tinlizzie.org/ometa/) |  
| [multischeme](https://github.com/ojarjur/multischeme), also [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7166755) | Multitasking library | Scheme | "perform preemptive multitasking entirely at compile time (or at program load time for apps not included when you build a binary for your OS)", "much faster than using the native primitives usually used for building multitasking support" |
| [pie](https://github.com/5HT/pie) | Editor | Erlang | "Emacs written in Erlang", "Text is stored as a tree of binaries ... Buffers are small servers" |
| [Chaos](http://sdegutis.github.io/chaos/), also [here](https://github.com/sdegutis/chaos) and [here](https://github.com/sdegutis/chaos/blob/master/Chaos/editor.lua) | Editor | Lua | "written using its own extension API which is written in Lua! ... The only part written in native code is the part that draws the characters ... It's just a grid of fixed-width text. ... no fancy GUI ... clear advantages over text editors with fancy rendering engines." For Mac OS X. |
| [Java Optimized Processor (JOP)](http://www.jopdesign.com/) also [here](http://www.jopdesign.com/doc/rtarch.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/jop-devel/jop) | Java Virtual Machine implemented in hardware | Java, VHDL | "... direct implementation of all bytecodes in hardware is not a useful approach ... Microcode is the native instruction set for JOP.  Bytecodes are translated, during their execution, into JOP microcode. This translation merely adds one pipeline stage to the core processor and results in no execution overheads ...  43 of the 201 different bytecodes are implemented by a single microcode instruction, 93 by a microcode sequence, and 40 bytecodes are implemented in Java." |
