Here are some language processors for Python and/or in Python.

| Processor | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| [CPython](http://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html) | Interpreter, compiler | Reference implementation from [python.org](http://www.python.org/).  [Source](http://hg.python.org/cpython/branches) (pick a version, then select *browse*, for example [2.7](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/c163e5011bd3)).  [Developers' Guide](http://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html), for example [here](http://docs.python.org/devguide/setup.html#directory-structure) and [here](http://docs.python.org/devguide/compiler.html).  [API](http://docs.python.org/2.7/c-api/index.html).  [Video](http://pyvideo.org/video/635/stepping-through-cpython), also [here](http://pyvideo.org/video/1777/all-singing-all-dancing-python-bytecode).  Here is a [brief explanation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3299648/python-compilation-interpretation-process?rq=1) and [links](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5216634/a-good-book-article-about-python-interpreter?lq=1) to others (more recently [here](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/category/programming/python/python-internals/)).  Still more starting [here](http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/WhyCPythonBytecode). |
| [Python Language Services](http://docs.python.org/2/library/language.html) | Compiler components, API, etc. | From the [Python Standard Library](http://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html).  "modules to assist in working with the Python language. These modules support tokenizing, parsing, syntax analysis, bytecode disassembly, and various other facilities." |
| [ Python compiler package](http://docs.python.org/2/library/compiler.html) | Alternate compiler, API, etc. | From the [Python Standard Library](http://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html), source code [here](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3edf679917ba/Lib/compiler), additional support tools [here](https://github.com/cloudmeter/python/tree/master/Tools/compiler).  "a Python source to bytecode translator written in Python." "The full functionality of the package duplicates the built-in compiler provided with the Python interpreter." "Deprecated since version 2.6: The compiler package has been removed in Python 3." |
| [UCPy](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/papers/ucpy.pdf), also [here](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/papers/mamba.pdf) | Compiler, assembler/linker, virtual machine | "Reverse-Engineering Python", targeting Python 1.5.2 with some 2.x in 2002.  "Our new virtual machine ... *mamba* has 19 instructions compared to CPython's 103 instructions." "This reduction ... is accomplished by removing functionality from instructions and relocating that functionality into objects ..." |
| [Unladen Swallow](https://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/wiki/ProjectPlan), outcome [here](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3146/) | Compiler | CPython branch ca. 2009 aiming at "a performance improvement of 5x ...".  The goal was not met. Relevant background literature [here](https://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/wiki/RelevantPapers). |
| [Cython](http://cython.org/), also [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6114334) | Optimizing compiler, C extensions | "Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language. ... a superset of the Python language that additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code ... makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries ... and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python ...".  Only works with CPython.  |
|[Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) | Compiler | "just-in-time specializing compiler which compiles annotated Python and NumPy code to LLVM (through decorators) ... produce optimized native code ... integrate with native foreign languages" |
| [Falcon](http://www.phi-node.com/2013/06/how-fast-can-we-make-interpreted-python.html), also [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6047) and [here](https://github.com/rjpower/falcon) | Optimized interpreter | ".. a high-performance bytecode interpreter fully compatible with the standard CPython interpreter. ... does not replace the standard CPython interpreter, but rather runs inside of it ... 25% faster than the standard Python interpreter on most benchmarks and in some cases about 2.5X faster."  The [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6047) discusses CPython internals and the [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5943258) has some interesting comments on Python design and performance. |
| [PyPy](http://pypy.org/), also [here](http://www.aosabook.org/en/pypy.html)  | Interpreter, translator, JIT compiler | "a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language (2.7.3)." "... except for a negligible number of C stubs, is written completely in Python."  Not compatible with extensions written for CPython; they must be ported.  Bytecode interpreter [here](http://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/interpreter.html).  Nice summary [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6708867).  Video about experimenter's experiences [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_HBRhcgeuQ). |
| [cffi](http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html), also [here](http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/08/cffi-release-03.html) | FFI for PyPy | "Foreign Function Interface for Python calling C code. The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python. The interface is based on LuaJIT’s FFI. ... The goal is to call C code from Python. You should be able to do so without learning a 3rd language: every alternative requires you to learn their own language (Cython, SWIG) or API (ctypes)."  From the PyPy project, works with CPython |

These methods of objects may not actually be coded for in Python ... the PVM is unaware, in the majority of cases, of what actually needs to be done to manipulate objects, it just makes calls to non Python code. ... how to go about dealing with this in a Python processor? |
| [pyCPU](http://pycpu.wordpress.com/), also [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pycpu/) | Bytecode interpreter for FPGA | "an implementation of a hardware CPU in [myHDL](http://www.myhdl.org).
