| Processor | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| [PyPy](http://pypy.org/), also [here](http://www.aosabook.org/en/pypy.html)  | Interperter, Translator | "a Python implementation and a dynamic language implementation framework. ... PyPy, except for a negligible number of C stubs, is written completely in Python." |
| [cffi](http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html), also [here](http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/08/cffi-release-03.html) | C extension | "Foreign Function Interface for Python calling C code. The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python. The interface is based on LuaJITâ€™s FFI. ... The goal is to call C code from Python. You should be able to do so without learning a 3rd language: every alternative requires you to learn their own language (Cython, SWIG) or API (ctypes)."  From the PyPy project. |
