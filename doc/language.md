Here are some language processors for Python.

| Processor | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| [CPython](http://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html) | Interpreter, compiler | Reference implementation from [python.org](http://www.python.org/).  [Source](http://hg.python.org/cpython/branches) (pick a version, then browse).  [Developers' Guide](http://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html), for example [here](http://docs.python.org/devguide/setup.html#directory-structure) and [here](http://docs.python.org/devguide/compiler.html).  [API](http://docs.python.org/2.7/c-api/index.html).  [Video](http://pyvideo.org/video/635/stepping-through-cpython), also [here](http://pyvideo.org/video/1777/all-singing-all-dancing-python-bytecode).  Here is a [brief explanation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3299648/python-compilation-interpretation-process?rq=1) and [links](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5216634/a-good-book-article-about-python-interpreter?lq=1) to others. |
| [Cython](http://cython.org/) | Optimizing compiler, C extensions | "Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language. ... a superset of the Python language that additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code ... makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries ... and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python ...".  Only works with CPython.  |
| [Falcon](http://www.phi-node.com/2013/06/how-fast-can-we-make-interpreted-python.html), also [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6047) and [here](https://github.com/rjpower/falcon) | Optimized interpreter | ".. a high-performance bytecode interpreter fully compatible with the standard CPython interpreter. ... does not replace the standard CPython interpreter, but rather runs inside of it ... 25% faster than the standard Python interpreter on most benchmarks and in some cases about 2.5X faster."  The [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6047) discusses CPython internals and the [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5943258) has some interesting comments on Python design and performance. |
| [PyPy](http://pypy.org/), also [here](http://www.aosabook.org/en/pypy.html)  | Interpreter, translator, JIT compiler | "a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language (2.7.3)." "... except for a negligible number of C stubs, is written completely in Python."  Not compatible with extensions written for CPython; they must be ported. |
| [cffi](http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html), also [here](http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/08/cffi-release-03.html) | FFI for PyPy | "Foreign Function Interface for Python calling C code. The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python. The interface is based on LuaJITâ€™s FFI. ... The goal is to call C code from Python. You should be able to do so without learning a 3rd language: every alternative requires you to learn their own language (Cython, SWIG) or API (ctypes)."  From the PyPy project. |
