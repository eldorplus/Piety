Here are some language processors for Python.

| Processor | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| [CPython](http://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html) | Interpreter, compiler | Reference implementation from [python.org](http://www.python.org/).  [Source](http://hg.python.org/cpython/branches) (pick a version, then select *browse*, for example [2.7](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/c163e5011bd3)).  [Developers' Guide](http://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html), for example [here](http://docs.python.org/devguide/setup.html#directory-structure) and [here](http://docs.python.org/devguide/compiler.html).  [API](http://docs.python.org/2.7/c-api/index.html).  [Video](http://pyvideo.org/video/635/stepping-through-cpython), also [here](http://pyvideo.org/video/1777/all-singing-all-dancing-python-bytecode).  Here is a [brief explanation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3299648/python-compilation-interpretation-process?rq=1) and [links](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5216634/a-good-book-article-about-python-interpreter?lq=1) to others. |
| [Python Language Services](http://docs.python.org/2/library/language.html) | Compiler components, API, etc. | From the [Python Standard Library](http://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html).  "modules to assist in working with the Python language. These modules support tokenizing, parsing, syntax analysis, bytecode disassembly, and various other facilities." |
| [ Python compiler package](http://docs.python.org/2/library/compiler.html) | Alternate compiler, API, etc. | From the [Python Standard Library](http://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html), source code [here](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3edf679917ba/Lib/compiler). "a Python source to bytecode translator written in Python." "The full functionality of the package duplicates the built-in compiler provided with the Python interpreter." "Deprecated since version 2.6: The compiler package has been removed in Python 3." |
| [Cython](http://cython.org/), also [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6114334) | Optimizing compiler, C extensions | "Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language. ... a superset of the Python language that additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code ... makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries ... and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python ...".  Only works with CPython.  |
| [Falcon](http://www.phi-node.com/2013/06/how-fast-can-we-make-interpreted-python.html), also [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6047) and [here](https://github.com/rjpower/falcon) | Optimized interpreter | ".. a high-performance bytecode interpreter fully compatible with the standard CPython interpreter. ... does not replace the standard CPython interpreter, but rather runs inside of it ... 25% faster than the standard Python interpreter on most benchmarks and in some cases about 2.5X faster."  The [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6047) discusses CPython internals and the [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5943258) has some interesting comments on Python design and performance. |
| [PyPy](http://pypy.org/), also [here](http://www.aosabook.org/en/pypy.html)  | Interpreter, translator, JIT compiler | "a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language (2.7.3)." "... except for a negligible number of C stubs, is written completely in Python."  Not compatible with extensions written for CPython; they must be ported. Nice summary [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6708867).  Video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_HBRhcgeuQ) |
| [cffi](http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html), also [here](http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2012/08/cffi-release-03.html) | FFI for PyPy | "Foreign Function Interface for Python calling C code. The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python. The interface is based on LuaJITâ€™s FFI. ... The goal is to call C code from Python. You should be able to do so without learning a 3rd language: every alternative requires you to learn their own language (Cython, SWIG) or API (ctypes)."  From the PyPy project. |
| [PyPy.js](http://www.rfk.id.au/blog/entry/pypy-js-first-steps/), also [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6090041) | Python-to-Javascript compiler | " have the RPython toolchain (from PyPy) compile things down to C code; compile the C code to JavaScript using Emscripten".  The page also discusses other Python-to-Javascript systems including *Skulpt*, *Brython*, *Pyjamas*, and *repl.it* |
| [gccpy](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/PythonFrontEnd), also [here](https://github.com/redbrain/gccpy) and [here](http://redbrain.co.uk/compiling-python-with-gccpy/) | Compiler | "compile Python Code as an AOT (ahead of time) compiled language",  "a python front end to GCC" |
| [Replicant](https://github.com/soundspectrum/replicant) | Compiler | "LLVM-based Python compiler and execution environment with a focus on performance, no-GIL threading, embeddability, and extensibility." |
| [Byterun](https://github.com/nedbat/byterun), also [here](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201301/byterun_and_making_cells.html) | Bytecode interpreter | "a pure-Python implementation of a Python bytecode execution virtual machine".  More about Python bytecodes [here](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200804/the_structure_of_pyc_files.html). |
