Here are some examples of system software and utilities written in
Python, or programmable in Python.

| Component | Type | Python role | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [coroutines](http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/) | Programming technique | Source | "...  a practical exploration of using Python coroutines (extended generators) for solving problems in data processing, event handling, and concurrent programming."  "Part 7: Writing an Operating System" includes lots of code samples. |
| [TCPStack](https://github.com/dound/vns/blob/master/TCPStack.py) | Network | Source | Lightweight TCP stack.  Part of [VNS](http://yuba.stanford.edu/vns/), the "Virtual Network System for teaching and experimentation" (also [here](http://yuba.stanford.edu/vns/files/pub/vns_sigcse.pdf)). |
| [Linux Framebuffer](http://blog.daum.net/nskystars/2626663) | Graphics | Source | "Drawing to the Linux Framebuffer in Python" Writes to /dev/fb0 using fcntl, mmap, struct.  Looks like a general technique for doing low-level I/O in Linux.  Based on C code [here](http://doc.qt.digia.com/3.0/emb-framebuffer-howto.html), but simpler. |
| [Python X Library](http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net/) | Graphics | Source | "a fully functional X client library for Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, in contrast to earlier X libraries for Python (the ancient X extension and the newer plxlib) which were interfaces to the C Xlib." |
| [PyCairo](http://www.tortall.net/mu/wiki/CairoTutorial), also [here](http://cairographics.org/pycairo/) | Graphics | Binding | "Cairo is a 2D (vector) graphics library ... (that) provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.)", "Cairo is implemented as a library written in the C programming language, but bindings are available for several different programming languages." "Pycairo is a set of Python bindings ..." Cairo can write to the [Linux framebuffer](http://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2010-July/020378.html). |
| [tinywm](http://incise.org/tinywm.html) | Window manager | Source | "a tiny window manager that I created as an exercise in minimalism. ... It is only around 50 lines of C. There is also a Python version using python-xlib." |
| [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/), also [here](http://docs.qtile.org/en/latest/) and [here](https://github.com/qtile/qtile) | Window manager | Source, Client | "Qtile is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager written in Python." |
| [uzbl](http://uzbl.org/), also [here](https://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl) | Browser | Wrapper | "Uses WebKitGtk+ for rendering and network interaction", "Uses a set of scripts (mostly Python) ... so things work out of the box; yet plenty of room for customization."  |
| [terminal](http://blog.daum.net/nskystars/2644517) | Terminal | Source | "A Simple Linux Framebuffer Terminal in Python (and C)" using the techniques above | 
| [peppy](http://peppy.flipturn.org/) | Editor | Wrapper | "an XEmacs-like editor in Python", "wrap(s) the wonderful [Scintilla](http://www.scintilla.org/) editing component" |
| [Wily](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/wily/pythonpaper.html), also [here](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/wily/python.html) | Editor | Client | "Wily emulates in the Unix and X Windows environment the Acme editor from Plan 9." " Wily is an editing environment which can be extended with Python programs. Instead of using an embedded Python interpreter, Wily talks a simple message protocol, and a module lets Python speak the same protocol." |

Key to **Python role** column

* **Source**
The component is written in Python.  It can be extended by revising or
adding to the Python source.

* **Binding** 
The component is a library written in another language,
with a Python API as an alternative to the native API, so the library
can be easily used by Python programs.

* **Wrapper** 
The component is a program whose core is written in another language,
that is invoked by a Python wrapper.  The program can be scripted or 
customized in Python.

* **Client**
The component is a server written in another language that
communicates using a protocol that has a Python API, so the server can
be easily used by Python programs.
