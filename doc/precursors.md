This seductive idea recurs among each generation of programmers.  It
has inspired some interesting experiments and a few practical systems.
Here are some examples.

| System | Era | Language | Substrate    | Platform  | Applications |
| ------ | --- | -------- | -------- | -------   | ------- |
| [Unix](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/hist.html)  | 1969 - | C | Bare machine | PDP 7, PDP 11, ... | Programming<br> Document preparation  |
| Smalltalk | 1970s | Smalltalk | Bare machine | Xerox Alto, ...<br>(purpose-built) | Education |
| Lisp Machines | 1970s, 80s | Lisp | Bare machine | Symbolics, LMI, ...<br>(purpose-built)| Artificial Intelligence |
