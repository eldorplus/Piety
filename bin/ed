Run a Piety session including the ed line editor.

This script shows how to ensure that console focus is switched between
the two console tasks: the shell pysht and the application ed.
However, the method it uses for this works, but is now deprecated: it
monkeypatches ed.run and ed.q.  It is better to use console.Command,
see edd for an example.
