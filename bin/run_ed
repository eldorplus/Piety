"""
Start a Piety session *with the ed* editor running in an interactive
Python session

 python -i run_ed

From the Piety python prompt pysh>>  type ed() to enter ed command mode.
To return to pysh from ed command mode,  type q.

If you exit from pysh or interrupt it, you will still be in Python
and can resume your Piety session with resume()

You can also start a standalone Piety-with-ed session at the command line:

 run_ed

But here, if you exit or interrupt Piety you will also exit Python.
