Piety directories
=================

Piety is organized into these directories:

- **applications**: miscellaneous applications

- **bin**: shell scripts that configure Piety for Unix-like platforms

- **console**: modules used by terminal applications

- **doc**: notes and documents

- **editors**: text editor applications: *ed* line editor and *edd*
    display editor

- **scheduler**: modules that define and schedule tasks, jobs, and
    sessions.

- **scripts**: Python scripts that run applications as tasks or jobs
    under the Piety sheduler.

- **shell**: Python shell application: *pysh*

- **test**: shell scripts and modules that test code in other
     directories.

- **unix**: modules for running Piety on a Unix-like host.
     We may add directories for other platforms in the future.

- **vt_terminal**: modules for running Piety terminal applications on
    a VT-100 compatible terminal.  We may add directories for other
    terminals in the future.

Each directory contains a *README* file with more information.  The
rationale for this organization is explained [here](doc/structure.md).
