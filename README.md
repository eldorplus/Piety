Piety
=====

**Piety** is a notional operating system to be written in Python.  It
is a response to this impulse:

> *Today's operating systems and applications are bloated and
> complicated.  Let's start over, and create a complete system that is
> small, easy to understand, and fun to program.  And, let's build it
> all in our favorite language!*

This repository contains some notes and experiments in these
directories:

- **doc**, notes and documents

- **piety**, scheduler

- **samples**, samples to run under the scheduler
