Editor tests
============

Tests for *ed.py*.  For explanations and instructions, see each
module's docstrings.

The *.py* files test the API.  The *.sh* files test command mode.

The *.log* files are output from *python test_ed.py > test_ed.log*,
*./test_ed.sh > test_ed.sh.log*  etc.

The *.txt* files here are samples used to demonstrate text editing.
The *ed.py.txt*, *ed.md.txt*, and *README.md.txt* here are not
up-to-date with their original namesakes.
