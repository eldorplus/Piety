ed.py - ed is the standard text editor.

ed is a line-oriented text editor written in pure Python.  It provides
some of the commands from the classic Unix editor ed, augmented with
commands for managing multiple buffers and files from the later Unix
:(and Plan 9) editor, sam.  You can use it in a command mode that
:emulates Unix ed, or use its API to edit from the Python prompt or
:write editing scripts in Python.
