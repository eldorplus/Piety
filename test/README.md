Piety tests
===========

Tests for some Piety modules.  Also, many Piety modules have a *main*
method or a *run* method that acts as a test.  Moreover, the contents
of *Piety/scripts* can act as tests or demonstrations.

All of these tests assume the execution path and Python path are set
as in *Piety/bin/piety_paths*.  For detailed directions, see the
docstrings in each test module.

- **ed**, directory of tests for *ed*.
