This directory contains Python modules for running Piety on a
Unix-like host operating system (including Linux and Mac OS X).

To run Piety on a Unix-like host operating system, put this directory
on the PYTHONPATH.  To run on a different kind of host, put modules
with the same module names and function names in a different directory
with a different name (*windows* for example) and put that directory
on the PYTHONPATH instead.
